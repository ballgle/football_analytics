Description: This is ScraperFC, a Python package that I hope will give more people access to soccer stats. It's still very much a work in progress and I'm currently a full-time grad student so progress may be slow. I am trying to chip away at it though, so please, reach out with any problems you encounter or features you want to see added!
        
        To install ScraperFC, run ```pip install ScraperFC``` from the command line.
        
        Data can be scraped from the following sources:
        * [FBRef](https://fbref.com/en/)
        * [Understat](https://understat.com/)
        * [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/)
        * [WhoScored](https://www.whoscored.com/)
        
        For usage examples, look at Examples.ipynb in the code directory.
        
        All data used in the data viz examples is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LhW3wcG5uoAAHcgPHRcJYmIQaMY9GlRI?usp=sharing.
